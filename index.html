            Mark McGwire, folks, the man, the myth, the legend. 
            This guy was hitting baseballs like he was trying to knock satellites out of orbit. 
            Grew up in California, built like a Greek god by the time he hit high school. 
            Then he gets to the big leagues and it’s like watching a demolition derby at a county fair—just smashing records like they're cheap piñatas.
             But then, surprise surprise, the steroid scandal hits. 
             Yeah, turns out he was juicing more than a trendy juice bar in Brooklyn. 
             And come on, look at the guy. Did anyone actually believe those biceps came from eating kale salads? Now he’s stuck in this weird purgatory, the Hall of Fame of ‘Almost Legends.’ 
             But let’s not forget, he gave us that one insane summer where every at-bat felt like the climax of an action movie. 
             And honestly, isn’t that the essence of baseball? Watching overgrown men bash things with sticks.
